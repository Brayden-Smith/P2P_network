# CNT4007 Final Project

## Group Members: Layth Ghnaim, Brayden Smith, Cesar Valentin

Overall, we believe that everyone contributed pretty equally to the project, but here is our individual breakdowns:

### Layth
Setup both the main and peer files, allowing the peer to read from config files and internalizing its data.  
Completely Implemented unchoking, choking, request, and piece message sending, handlers and connections throughout the file, and the actual sending and downloading of the files with binary data.  
Finished main by turning it into a loop that refreshes preferred and optimistic neighbors and the specified intervals.  
Fixed numerous bugs on topics such as peer connection order, repeated logs,  binary bitmap formatting, and proper shutdown.  
Added logging to a couple of the functions.
